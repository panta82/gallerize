# Gallerize

Create a media gallery straight from Windows Explorer or desktop context menu.

### Usage:

1. Right click on any file or directory or selection of items. Select Gallerize and decide whether to include subdirectories.

2. An HTML image gallery opens in your default browser. Watch the images using browser UI instead of some desktop app.

That's it.

### Installation

Go to the [releases](releases) page and download the latest release.

Unzip it.

Run Setup.exe.

You will need to approve admin rights in UAC prompt. This is because we need to install a "shell extension" that allows the right-click context menu you see on screenshots. The extension will be removed once you uninstall the program.

Tested on Windows 10.
